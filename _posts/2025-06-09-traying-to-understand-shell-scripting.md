In this post, we are trying to understand about shell scripting. As per wikipedia, A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.
A script is command line program that contains a series of commands. The commands contained in the script are executed by interpreter. In case of shell scripts, the shell acts as interpreter and executes the commands listed in the script one after another.
