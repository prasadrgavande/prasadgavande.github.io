In this post, we are going to take a look on some essential and useful linux / unix commands that are being used for day to day operations

## Commands for directory operations 
### ls 
This command is use to list content in folder

```
ls [options] [directory or path]
```
example , if I am inside /etc/ folder, and if I execute command then I can see all folders inside /etc/ folder as below

```
root@Prabhu:/etc# ls
PackageKit              cron.daily      fstab       kernel          mime.types           polkit-1      selinux            sysctl.d

There are many other options, but I use above options in my day to day life 

### pwd 
This command is used to print full path of current directory
```
pwd [options]
```
Example
```
root@Prabhu:/etc# pwd
/etc
```
It has several options as below 
-L, --logical: use PWD from environment, even if it contains symlinks
-P, --physical: avoid all symlinks

### cd 
This command is used for navigation 
```
cd [directory path where you want to go]
```

```
root@Prabhu:/etc# pwd
/etc
root@Prabhu:/etc# cd pm
root@Prabhu:/etc/pm#
```

if you want to go to some other folder of specific path then we can pass full directory path as below
```
root@Prabhu:/etc/pm# pwd
/etc/pm
root@Prabhu:/etc/pm# cd /var/run/log
root@Prabhu:/var/run/log#
```

cd command also provides some shortcuts as below

`cd` : returns to current user's home directory

`cd ..` : go to one level up

`cd -` : go to previous directory 


### mkdir 
This command is used to create new directory
```
mkdir dir_name
```
Example

root@Prabhu:~/prasad# ls
testing
root@Prabhu:~/prasad#
```

### rmdir 
This command is used to remove empty directory
```
rmdir dir_name
```
Example
```
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# ls
testing
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# rmdir testing
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# ls
root@Prabhu:~/prasad#
```
> Note: this command can only delete empty folders, if you have any file / folder inside this folder then this command cannot be used.


## Commands for file operations 

### touch
This command is used to create new empty file in folder or to update timestamp of existing file

```
touch [option] file_name.extension
```
Example:
```
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# ls

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  16 Jun 11 23:33 test.txt
root@Prabhu:~/shell#
```

If you want to copy whole directory including its files and sub folders then need to use option -r along with this.

Example: if I want to copy folder /etc/ssh along with its sub folders and files then execute commands as below

```
root@Prabhu:~#
root@Prabhu:~# cp -r /etc/ssh/ prasad
root@Prabhu:~# cd prasad
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# ls -ltr

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jun 11 23:38 ssh
root@Prabhu:~/prasad# cd ssh
root@Prabhu:~/prasad/ssh# ls -ltr
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 11 23:38 ssh_config.d
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1649 Jun 11 23:38 ssh_config
root@Prabhu:~/prasad/ssh#
```
