With over a decade of experience in the Information Technology sector, I specialize in the support and maintenance of back-office settlement systems within the Investment Banking industry. My expertise encompasses production support, development of new functionalities, resolution of system issues, and enhancements to existing systems to ensure operational excellence and reliability.

Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with diverse stakeholders across the APAC region, including departments such as Finance, Infrastructure, and Governance. My contributions have been instrumental in the development and ongoing maintenance of critical applications, including SharePoint, ServiceNow, Confluence, and JIRA.

I possess a solid foundation in C++ development and am adept at analyzing both functional and technical specifications. My skills extend to the programming, implementation, documentation, and testing of software applications.

My technical proficiency spans a range of programming languages and technologies, including C++, C#, shell scripting, RESTful Web Services, and web-based technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am eager to embrace new challenges and am committed to leveraging my skills to contribute to the success of my team.
