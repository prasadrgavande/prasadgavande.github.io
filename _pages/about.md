I am a seasoned Software Engineer with a strong background in developing and maintaining settlement systems for the Investment Banking sector. With over ten years of experience, my career has been marked by a dedication to creating robust back-office solutions that drive operational success.

My technical journey includes significant contributions to the development of new functionalities, addressing system issues, and enhancing existing applications to meet the evolving needs of the business. While I have a history of providing production support, my current role is centered on settlement system development, ensuring these critical systems operate with precision and efficiency.

In previous roles, I have worked with applications like SharePoint, ServiceNow, Confluence, and JIRA. However, my focus has shifted to exclusively support the settlement domain, where I apply my extensive knowledge in C++ and other programming languages.

Skilled in C++, C#, and shell scripting, I also bring experience with RESTful Web Services and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My approach involves thorough analysis, meticulous programming, and comprehensive testing to deliver high-quality software solutions.

I am always ready to tackle new challenges and am keen to apply my expertise to enhance team performance and achieve collective goals.
