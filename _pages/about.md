I am a Hong Kong–based Senior Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience building and modernizing mission-critical systems for global investment banks and capital markets.

I specialize in designing, developing, and optimizing Post-Trade, Settlement, and Compliance platforms used by front-office, middle-office, and operations teams. My work supports high-volume financial transactions, regulatory reporting, SWIFT messaging, and CCASS settlement workflows — where accuracy, performance, and reliability are non-negotiable.

Currently, I work with Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong, developing and supporting large-scale financial systems using C#, C++, SQL, and cloud-based infrastructure. I have delivered high-impact solutions including automated compliance platforms, trade migration engines, SWIFT processing systems, and settlement reconciliation tools that handle millions of records with zero data loss.

My technical expertise includes:
• C# and C++ enterprise application development  
• Post-Trade, Settlement, SWIFT, CCASS and Bloomberg integration  
• SQL Server and Oracle performance optimization  
• Cloud migration (AWS), CI/CD and automation  
• Regulatory reporting and compliance systems  

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge deep technical engineering with real business outcomes — reducing operational risk, improving processing speed, and ensuring regulatory accuracy in complex banking environments.

I am always open to exciting opportunities, consulting, or collaboration in Investment Banking, FinTech, and Financial Systems Engineering.
